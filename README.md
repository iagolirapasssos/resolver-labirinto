## Example Code

Here is a simple example demonstrating how to use the available commands to navigate through the maze:

```javascript
// Improved navigateMaze function using the Right-Hand Rule

async function navigateMaze() {
    // Continue navigating until the flag is found
    while (!await ver_bandeira()) {
        // Check the distance to the front
        let distanceFront = await ultra_frente();
        // Check the distance to the right
        let distanceRight = await ultra_direita();
        // Check the distance to the left
        let distanceLeft = await ultra_esquerda();
        
        if (distanceFront > 0) {
            // If there is space in front, move forward
            await mover(1);
        } else if (distanceRight > 0) {
            // If blocked in front but space to the right, turn right and move forward
            await rotacionar(90);
            await mover(1);
        } else if (distanceLeft > 0) {
            // If blocked in front and to the right but space to the left, turn left and move forward
            await rotacionar(-90);
            await mover(1);
        } else {
            // If blocked in all directions, turn around (180 degrees)
            await rotacionar(180);
        }
    }
    // Once the flag is found, display a success message
    await escrever("Flag found!");
}

// Start navigating the maze
navigateMaze();

```

### Explanation:

1. **Loop Until Flag is Found:**
   - The `while` loop continues until `ver_bandeira()` returns `true`.

2. **Check Distance Ahead:**
   - If there is space (`distanceFront > 0`), move forward.

3. **Rotate and Check Right:**
   - If blocked ahead, rotate 90 degrees to the right.
   - Check the distance to the right.
   - If space is available, move forward.
   - If not, rotate back to the original direction.

4. **Log Success:**
   - Once the flag is found, display a success message.

## Tips

- **Use Loops and Conditionals:**
  - Utilize `while` and `for` loops along with `if-else` statements to create dynamic navigation strategies.

- **Leverage Sensors:**
  - Combine sensor readings with conditional logic to make informed decisions about movements and rotations.

- **Ensure Asynchronous Operations:**
  - Remember to use `await` before functions like `mover()`, `rotacionar()`, and sensor functions to ensure actions complete before proceeding.

- **Experiment with Strategies:**
  - Try different movement and rotation patterns to find the most efficient path to the flag.

## Challenges

1. **Ensure Always Reaching the Flag:**
   - Create an algorithm that guarantees the car will find the flag, regardless of the maze layout.

2. **Optimize for Shortest Path:**
   - Modify your code to find the shortest possible path to the flag, minimizing the number of movements.

3. **Implement a Scoring System:**
   - Introduce a scoring mechanism based on the number of moves or time taken to reach the flag.

4. **Visual Enhancements:**
   - Add visual indicators for visited cells or the path taken by the car to improve clarity.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Enhance your code to handle unexpected scenarios, such as getting stuck or encountering dead ends.

## Features

- **Interactive Maze Generation:**
  - Generate mazes of varying sizes and complexities to challenge your programming skills.

- **Asynchronous Control:**
  - Utilize `async` and `await` to manage car movements and sensor readings seamlessly.

- **Comprehensive Sensor Integration:**
  - Access detailed sensor data to make intelligent navigation decisions.

- **User-Friendly Interface:**
  - Intuitive layout with separate areas for the maze, code editor, controls, and output.

- **Responsive Design:**
  - The maze and car adjust dynamically to different screen sizes for optimal viewing.

## Additional Notes

### Adding the `bussola()` Function to `script.js`

To fully utilize the `bussola()` function, ensure that it's included in your `script.js`. Here's how you can integrate it:

```javascript
// Fun√ß√£o b√∫ssola para obter posi√ß√£o e dire√ß√£o do carro
async function bussola() {
    const pos = await posicao();
    return { x: pos.x, y: pos.y, angle: carAngle };
}
```

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
async function getCompassInfo() {
    let compass = await bussola();
    log(`Car is at (${compass.x}, ${compass.y}) facing ${compass.angle} degrees`);
}

getCompassInfo();
```

### Ensuring the Flag is in a Valid White Area for Level 1

With the updated `generateMaze` function, the flag is now guaranteed to be placed on a white cell. However, for Level 1 (10x10), you might want to verify the maze generation to ensure optimal pathfinding. Here's how you can manually adjust the maze if needed:

1. **Check the Flag Position:**
   - After generating the maze, ensure that `endPosition` is accessible from `carPosition`.
   
2. **Manual Adjustment (Optional):**
   - If you notice that the flag is not reachable, you can manually carve a path by setting specific cells to `0` to ensure connectivity.

3. **Testing:**
   - Generate multiple mazes for Level 1 to confirm that the flag placement works consistently.

By implementing these changes, your **Programmable Maze** will be more robust, user-friendly, and educational for those learning JavaScript and algorithmic problem-solving.
